In C programming, there are two ways to pass arguments to functions: pass by value and pass by reference.

1/ Pass by Value:
Pass by value means that a copy of the argument's value is passed to the function. 
This means that any changes made to the argument within the function do not affect
 the original value outside of the function. 

2/ Pass by Reference:
Pass by reference means that a reference to the argument's memory location is passed to the function. 
This means that any changes made to the argument within the function will affect the original value outside of the function.
