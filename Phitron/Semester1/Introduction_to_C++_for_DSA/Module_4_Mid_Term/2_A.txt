A class is a template that defines the characteristics and behavior of objects. Class has 
one or more variables. In main function we have to create some object of the class. after that we can access 
the variables of class by using dot(.) operator in between the object and variable name. For dynamic object we have to use
'->' sine  in between the object and variable name for access the variable of class.
 Declaration of an object: 

 int main()
 {
    Class_name object_name;
 }
 Here class_name is like a data type and object_name is like a variable.
